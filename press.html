        <p class="review"><span class="review-text">Fabrizio cries out in song, in his native Italian, of the
                impossibility of their sudden passion.
                His cry is magnificent—an onrush of anguish and melody and bell-ringing clarity. The sound of the human
                voice, perfectly placed, is distinctive.
                To reach that level of expertise is in itself an artistic accomplishment. But to reach that mastery and
                then let go of it - so that the heart's
                emotional storm can be given free voice - turns a good sound into a soul-stirring whisper that reaches
                through the music to touch our dreams. Shane
                Patrick O'Neil plays Fabrizio with simplicity and vulnerability. His passion and superb technique are
                thrilling.</span><br>

        <p class="review"><span class="review-text">It was stunning. I have to say that I experienced that moment again
                listening to Shane Patrick O'Neill
                inhabiting the world of Fabrizio Naccarelli. When he sings, Il Mondo Era Vuoto, everything is left on
                the boards. A magnificent celebration of
                voice, character and dialect. Never losing his Italian accent for a moment of acting or singing. Through
                his character we get to see lucid emotions
                of love and honesty for Clara. We follow his struggle with both families, trying to follow his unfeigned
                adoration for his love.</span><br>

                grab your attention and let you know that you’ll have fun and that you shouldn’t take this show (or
                yourself) too seriously. The humor is broad and campy. Jeff Blim and Kiley L. McDonald are delightful in
                the first scene ... but it’s the supreme awkwardness of Kelsey White and Shane Patrick O’Neill that
                confirm your solid appraisal of the show. </span><br>

        <p class="review"><span class="review-text">If you like laughing, head to the Palace: I recently checked out the
                Palace’s first show of the season, I Love You, You’re Perfect Now Change. I spent the majority of the
                show stretching my jaw because it was getting cramped from laughing so much. This musical is highly
                recommended for anyone who is married, has been in love or, heck, even if you’ve only been on a date.
                The four stars - Kiley McDonald, Shane Patrick O’Neill, Jeff Blim and Kelsey White - are chameleons who
                play so many different roles convincingly that at times it is difficult to tell who is who.</span><br>
